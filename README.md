- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Lamke
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software and systems engineering, philosophy, and creating a better world. 
- I have a background in C and low level programming and have been programming since the early 90s. C++ and Java (especially the latter) are wonderful for complex programming on a short schedule because there are open source libs for almost everything.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... The best way to reach me is to tweet at me @crlamke.
